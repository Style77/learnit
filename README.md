# LearnIT
A simple, easy to use, and **free** learning platform for everyone.

## What is LearnIT?
LearnIT is a platform that allows everyone to learn coding. It is a free and open source project that is currently in development.

## TODO
- change description of courses in constants.js and add more courses
- change allowed domains in `next.config.js` to some image proxy like https://cloudinary.com/
- update `README.md` and `LICENSE`
- update reposCount every few days (there should be some cron job for that)
- loading animations

## Considerations
##### Design and UX
- `+17 mln repozytoriów na GitHubie` or `17 mln repozytoriów na GitHubie` - we need to think what's looking better
- same with `Już wkrótce` or `Wkrótce` or `Coming soon`

^ These are just some thoughts, we can discuss it later. They doesn't really matter at that stage of development. I just wanted to write them down somewhere. `by @style77`


- We need to consider if card with course should open modal with course description or redirect to course page. (I think that it should open modal `by @style77`)
^ same with login button - should it redirect to login page or open modal with login form? (I think that it should open modal `by @style77`)
